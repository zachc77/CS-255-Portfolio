# CS-255- DriversPass Portfolio

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was for a client called DriverPass. They wanted an online system that helps people get ready for divers test. The system was meant to let the customer schedule driving lessons, take online practice test, and to make sure it tracked their progress.
The system also needed different roles such as students, teachers, and admins. 

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did a good job of realizing the clinets needs and turing it into clear requirements. I made sure I focused on what the client actually wanted.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I revised one part it would probably be the activity diagrams. I think they cover the main steps well, but I would clean them up by adding a bit more clarity to some of the decision points and the flow. To make sure everything that should be include is there and also make it easier to follow at a quick glance. 


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the users needs by reading through the interview and paying attention to what the client kept making clear. I designed the system to follow and match the needs from the interview. This is important because the whole point of the system is to help the user if its not easy to use and does not meet reqiremtents its not going to help the user.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I focus on planning and understanding the system before doing any code or anything. I first review the client requirements and figure out what the system needs to do from the users point of view
