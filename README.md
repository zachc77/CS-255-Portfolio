# CS-255- DriversPass Portfolio

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was for a client called DriverPass. They wanted an online system that helps people get ready for divers test. The system was meant to let the customer schedule driving lessons, take online practice test, and to make sure it tracked their progress.
The system also needed different roles such as students, teachers, and admins. 

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did a good job of realizing the clinets needs and turing it into clear requirements. I made sure I focused on what the client actually wanted.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?



How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?



How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
